    "**Goal:**\n",
    "The goal of this data is to use arrests in each neighborhood since 2016 to find which neighborhoods you are lest likely to be in the proximity of an arrest. While this does not show how likely you are to be a target of a crime as it does not account for population, it gives a general sense of safety as it shows how often you will be close to crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The neighborhoods where the least number of arrests occur are Troy Hill-Herrs Island, Mt. Oliver Boro, and Central Northside which have 6,18, and 23 arrests respectively. Mt. Oliver Niehgborhood was disincluded from the data as it is likely a misinput and is probably meant to just be Mount Oliver. Squirrel Hill South was chosen by my group as the overall winner despite a relatively low placement by my metric. This is likely in part due to the size of Squirrel Hill being much larger than most neighborhoods"

    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "     Project: Goal to find the most deserable neighborhood to live in for a certain group.\n",
    "     Approach: Discussed many different types of people that we could cater to including families, college students, those who liked                nature etc.\n",
    "     Process: We first looked through the data sets and found connections between data sets. We found many data sets including crime      reports, number of parks, and number of community facilities that all have a common thread. They would be appealing to know for      families that have children that are looking for a neighborhood that is safe and has places for their children to play.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal Metrics:**\n",
    "Neighborhood with largest amount of playground/parks.\n",
    "Neighborhood with largest amount of community facilities.\n",
    "Neighborhood with least amount of crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combined Metric:**\n",
    "What is the best neighborhood for a family with children who are looking for a safe environment to raise their children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best:\n",
    "Based on the data collected, the top three best neighborhoods are Squirrel Hill South with 8 parks, Beechview with 5 parks, and South Side Slopes with 5 pakrs. While there are other neighborhoods with 4 parks, the top three neighborhoods are the ones with the greatest number of parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction: Introduce the project, your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.\n",
    "The Metric: Describe your metric, what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?\n",
    "The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.\n",
    "Conclusion: Reflect on how the data driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this."
